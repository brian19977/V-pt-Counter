This program tallies V-points based on exported Mountain Project tick lists.

Compile as:

$ javac vpts.java

Run as (omitting angle brackets):

$ java vpts <name_of_file.*>

This program only tallies V-points, not YDS grades, Font grades, or any other. The file must be tab-delimited (i.e., .tsv for .txt)

In tabulation, VX+ == VX-Y == VY- for all X + 1 = Y.
